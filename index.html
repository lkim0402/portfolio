      Hello! I am a 3rd year CS student at University of Washington Seattle,
      specializing in AI and machine learning. I'm interested in building AI
      tools too.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      At 2021, I first attended community college at
      <a href="https://www.pierce.ctc.edu/">Pierce College, Lakewood</a> where I
      got my Associates of Science degree for 2 years until 2023.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then at 2023, I succesfully transferred into University of Washington
      Seattle where I majored in CS.
